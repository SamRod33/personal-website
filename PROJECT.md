1. Home Page

    ![home-page](/src/website-wireframe/Group%2019.png)

    **Design Choices**

        Repetition

            - Let’s Meet button on left side of page and in navigation bar is to remind audience I want to be contacted.

            - Additionally, placing it in multiple places makes it easier to be seen in case the audience looks at only one side of the page

        Alignment

            - Making the navigation bar aligned with a self portrait makes sure that it is pleasing to the eye and helps the navigation bar get noticed after users look at self portrait, or similarly for vice-versa.

            - Aligning Personal Statement, Quick About me, and Let’s Meet will make it easier for users to read quickly since it is a concentrated piece of text. Users have a clear straight downward path when looking at this section.

            - Aligning navigation bar horizontally encourages left-to-right psychological behavioral pattern  when reading, thus each section complements the other

        Proximity

            - Making the Personal Statement and about me close together helps users understand the purpose of my website when they immediately arrive to the website

            - Putting the navigation bar sections side by side help the user understand all the sections of my website

    **Rhetorical Situation**

        Contrast

            - White background will make the elements on the page pop out, especially since I will use a drop shadow for the Let’s Meet and My resume buttons.

            - White background contrasts with the filled-in with color navigation bar boxes

            - Self portrait visual on the right side of the page will contrast with the text on the left side of the page. This makes the focal point of this page be my self-portrait

        Purpose

            - I want my audience to get a sense of my identity, and with the contrast of my self-portrait, it will help them remember what I look like

        Audience

            - Highlighting skills, projects, and let’s meet sections on my arrival page signals that my audience is mainly for those interested in my professional experiences. So for instance, recruiters are looking for my technical capability so recruiters would be included as my audience.

        Context

            - Website existing on the internet means that while I made the website in NY, my website reaches an international audience and scale. So I want to reach as many people as possible so that they know my professional identity
